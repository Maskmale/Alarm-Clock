# ⏰ Alarm Clock
Proof of concept for our [Colored Alarm Clock Interface shot @ Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/5054031-Colored-Alarm-Clock-Interface)

<img src="./preview.gif" width="600"/>

Slider implemented as a subclass of UIControl. You can set slider title and max value right in Attributes Inspector in Interface Builder, thanks to @IBInspectable. Also you can choose Slider color using Tint Color property. And there is no need to run simulator to see final result – components are fully rendered in storyboard by @IBDesignable.
